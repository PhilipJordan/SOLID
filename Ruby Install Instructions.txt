
Go to http://rubyinstaller.org/ and download Ruby 1.9.3-p545 version

Install and choose add to PATH checkbox (optional: Associate files (and/or other checkbox) if you want. Will not hurt)

CHECK POINT: Open command prompt and type 'irb' (this should display the basic interactive ruby shell)
             If you type '1 + 1' and hit enter it should return 2
			 type 'exit' to exit the shell

			 
From command prompt:			 
			 
gem install watir-webdriver (this will also install several dependencies including selenium-webdriver)

gem install rspec -v 2.99

gem install page-object

gem install cucumber

gem install bundler

change directory to cucumber folder (c:\github\SOLID\OCP\Cukes\mars_rover_cukes)

bundle install (from cuke directory)

CHECK POINT: Make sure you didn't get any errors during these installs.

type 'bundle exec cucumber --tags @yourTagNameHere' (@missionControl is the default tag for the SOLID OCP talk)
