Install and add to PATH (optional: Associate files if you want. Will not hurt)

CHECK POINT: Open command prompt and type 'irb' (this should display the basic interactive ruby shell)
             If you type '1 + 1' and hit enter it should return 2
			 type 'exit' to exit the shell

gem install watir-webdriver (this will also install several dependencies including selenium-webdriver)

gem install rspec -v 2.99

gem install page-object
