Feature: Your mission if you choose to accept it

   As a Rover Commander
   I want to navigate an absurd maze on mars
   So I can see how cool it is
   
	Scenario: Queue the music
		Given the Mission page
		And an absurd maze of obstacles
		When I bust a move
		Then I will be free
		And I can move off the North edge
		And I can move off the East edge
